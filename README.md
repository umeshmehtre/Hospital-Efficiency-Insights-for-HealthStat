# Healthcare Data Analysis in Power BI - Hospital Efficiency Insights for HealthStat

## Objective
Enhancing efficiency while upholding superior patient care remains a paramount goal in healthcare. This Power BI project aims to pinpoint outliers in hospital performance and unravel the key attributes influencing both the length of stay (LOS) and cost per patient discharge. The exploration of a real-world dataset is undertaken on behalf of a fictional consulting company named HealthStat.

## Data
The dataset utilized in this case study encompasses diverse information, including patient demographics across various areas and regions, diagnoses, procedures, and the length of stay (LOS). Aggregated at the hospital level, this dataset facilitates the comparison of performance metrics across different healthcare facilities.

## Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data, focusing on identifying factors that impact patient LOS and cost. The investigation involves scrutinizing the efficiency variations among different hospitals.

### 1. LOS Comparison Dashboard:
This dashboard offers an in-depth comparison of the Length of Stay (LOS) in hospitals. It highlights key influencers affecting average LOS, identifies segments with the highest and lowest LOS days, and includes a comparative graph of the average LOS for the top 15 hospitals. The visualizations aid in understanding and optimizing patient care duration.

### 2. Cost Comparison Dashboard:
Providing a comprehensive cost comparison for hospitals, this dashboard includes key influencers affecting the average cost per discharge, the average length of stay (LOS) for patients, and the highest and lowest average cost per discharge. This data-driven approach assists in understanding and optimizing hospital performance.

### 3. Hospital Profile Dashboard:
This dashboard presents a comprehensive profile of each hospital. Metrics such as average Length of Stay (LOS), average LOS by diagnosis, total discharges by severity of illness and diagnosis description, and the average cost per discharge are included. This data offers valuable insights into hospital performance and patient care efficiency.

## Visualization
An array of visualizations, including charts and tables, have been crafted to effectively communicate insights to the HealthStat team. These visualizations are organized based on cost, length of stay, and hospital profile.

## Summary Dashboard
The Summary Dashboard consolidates all insights, providing an easily accessible platform for the HealthStat team or any user to track hospital performance. It offers a holistic view of the factors most influential in length of stay and cost per patient discharge, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.
